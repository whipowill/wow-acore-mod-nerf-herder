# Nerf Herder

An AzerothCore module for nerfing NPCs throughout the game to the appropriate level, such as guards and even faction leaders.

Primarily, this mod is intended for private servers limited to Vanilla or TBC, who want the towns folk to be limited to levels 60 or 70.

Secondarily, this mod is designed to detect [AutoBalance](https://github.com/azerothcore/mod-autobalance.git) and allow for invasion of faction cities and assassination of faction leaders.

Tertiarily, I might eventually add on some all around nerf/buff features for all classes.

THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS AND IS NOT READY FOR USE

## Methodology

This module uses [55Honey's ZoneDebuff](https://github.com/55Honey/Acore_ZoneDebuff/blob/master/zoneDebuff.lua) technique to apply a debuff to all townsfolk.
