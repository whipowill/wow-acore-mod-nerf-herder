# Nerf Herder

An AzerothCore module for nerfing NPCs en masse for various purposes.

- Nerf capitol guards to match max player level
- Nerf town guards to match zone recommended level
- Nerf high health NPCs to make world events easier
- Flag faction NPCs as PvP who grant honor on kill
- Enable world buff and money rewards for faction raids
- Hide PvP vendors who don't belong in the game

Does not affect world database.  Does not affect dungeons or raids.

## The Vision

On a server with only a few players, and no chance to do battlegrounds to accumulate honor, I wanted to make raiding enemy villages and towns a fun thing to do on a quiet evening.

Some of the villages, even in starter zones, have super high level NPCs that were originally meant to discourage players on PvP servers from ruining things for the other faction.

These guards will be nerfed to a level appropriate for their respective zones.  You'll be able to burn and pillage any town you have the strength to conquer, and you will be rewarded.

Finally, the coveted achievement of assassinating the enemy faction leaders is totally undoable in a normal server environment.  This mod will enable special nerfs to high health NPCs to make this possible.

Additional nerfs may be added over time to allow for a low population experience.
